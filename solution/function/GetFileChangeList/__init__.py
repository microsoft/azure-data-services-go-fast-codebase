# Gets a list of sync files from the Canvas API, and compares to files on-disk at a given location (determined by app settings)
# It relies on the fact that the Canvas Data Sync endpoint provides a list of filenames which are guaranteed to be unique and persistant
# See: https://portal.inshosteddata.com/docs/api
# Outputs:
#   - Dictionary object with keys:
#       - download: list of file object to download
#       - delete: List of local files to delete (as they are no longer required)
#       - schemaVersion: Version of the schema reported by the Canvas Data API. This should be retrieved for type/schema mapping activites.
